HackerRank Adventures
=====================

This repository holds my solutions for problems from HackerRank challenges.

It's mostly used for practicing random things and learning new algorithmic solutions. I'll try to create the most efficent solution for each problem. I do also accept any pull requests if you want to add a valid solution in a different language.

If you find any issues with the solutions in the repository, [open an issue](https://github.com/matinfazli/hackerrank/issues) and I'll check it out.

Cheers!
